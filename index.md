## Welcome to my blog
Hello world. This is my personal blog. The usual disclaimers obviously apply. The views espoused here are mine alone and not attributable to my employer. They're mostly silly, with, ocassional flashes of brilliance, one would hope. 

Most of it is going to be dictated by my interests so expect musings about data, availability of data, probably food, photos of dogs, immigration stuff and identity, and maybe education.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gabyd/werds_blog/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gabyd/werds_blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
